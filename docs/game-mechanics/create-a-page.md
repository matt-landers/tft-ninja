# Game Phases in TFT

Teamfight Tactics (TFT) matches are structured into several distinct phases, each contributing to the overall flow of the game. Understanding these phases is crucial for planning your actions and anticipating the game's progression. This document outlines the primary phases of a TFT match, focusing on the function and mechanics of each phase.

## Overview of Game Phases

A TFT match is divided into a series of cycles, each consisting of the following phases:

1. **Planning Phase**
2. **PvP (Player vs. Player) Rounds**
3. **PvE (Player vs. Environment) Rounds**
4. **Carousel Round**

### Planning Phase

The Planning Phase is a preparation period where players can manage their team and resources without the pressure of an ongoing battle. During this phase, you can:

- **Buy and Sell Champions:** Interact with the champion shop to add new champions to your board or sell unwanted champions for gold.
- **Rearrange Your Team:** Position your champions on the board to prepare for the upcoming battle.
- **Equip Items:** Combine or place items on your champions to enhance their abilities.
- **Level Up:** Spend gold to increase your player level, allowing you to place more champions on the board.

### PvP Rounds

PvP Rounds are the combat phases where your team fights against another player's team. The outcomes of these battles directly affect your health and positioning in the game. During PvP Rounds:

- **Automatic Battles:** Combat occurs automatically, with champions acting based on their AI.
- **Health Loss:** The losing player takes damage to their Little Legend based on the number of surviving enemy champions and their levels.

### PvE Rounds

PvE Rounds, also known as "monster rounds," feature battles against AI-controlled enemies. These rounds provide opportunities to earn additional items and gold. During PvE Rounds:

- **Unique Enemies:** Fight against different types of AI-controlled enemies, each with unique challenges.
- **Rewards:** Successful completion of these rounds grants items, gold, and occasionally champion orbs.

### Carousel Round

The Carousel Round is a unique phase where players select a champion equipped with an item from a rotating selection. The order of selection is determined by the players' standings in the match, with lower-ranked players choosing first. During the Carousel Round:

- **Champion and Item Selection:** Players pick from a limited selection of champions and items, which can be crucial for enhancing their team's strength.

## Conclusion

Understanding the distinct phases of a TFT match is essential for navigating the game effectively. Each phase plays a crucial role in the development of your strategy and the outcome of the match. Familiarity with what each phase entails allows for better planning and decision-making as you aim to outlast your opponents and claim victory.
