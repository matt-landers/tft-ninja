# Item Components in TFT

In Teamfight Tactics (TFT), item components are the foundational elements used to create powerful items that can significantly impact the outcome of a match. Understanding these components, their effects, and how they combine is crucial for strategic itemization and maximizing the potential of your champions. This document provides an overview of item components, offering insight into their role in TFT's dynamic gameplay.

## What Are Item Components?

Item components are basic items that grant specific stats or effects to the champions equipped with them. Each component can be combined with another component to create a completed item, which provides enhanced stats and unique abilities. There are nine basic item components in TFT, each offering different stat boosts:

## Combining Components

To create a completed item, simply place two item components on the same champion. The game automatically combines the components into a new item. Here's how combination works:

- **Pre-determined Recipes:** Each item component can be combined with any other component, including another of the same type, to create a completed item based on pre-determined recipes.
- **Strategic Combinations:** Some combinations are more beneficial for certain champions or team compositions than others. Experimenting with different combinations can reveal powerful synergies.

## Conclusion

Item components are the building blocks of your champions' strength in Teamfight Tactics. By understanding the effects and combination potential of each component, you can make informed decisions that enhance your team's performance and adapt to the evolving battlefield. Mastering item components and their combinations is a crucial step towards achieving victory in TFT.
