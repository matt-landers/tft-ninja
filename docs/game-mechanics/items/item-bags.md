# Understanding Item Bags in TFT

In Teamfight Tactics (TFT), item distribution is a critical component of strategy that can significantly influence the outcome of a match. A lesser-known mechanic that plays a vital role in this process is the concept of "Item Bags." This document explores the item bag mechanic, explaining how it works and its implications for gameplay.

## What Are Item Bags?

Every tactician (player) in TFT has a personal item bag. This bag determines which components are available to you throughout the game, particularly in the early stages. Understanding how your item bag works is crucial for planning your strategy and making informed decisions on itemization.

## How Item Bags Work

The item bag mechanic operates under a set of rules that govern item distribution:

- **Stage 1 Composition:** At the start of the game, your item bag contains one of each component. This ensures that you aren't dropped 3 of a single component, but it also means that you will never be offered 2 of a single component which means, for example, that you can never be dropped Blue Buff (2 tears), Deathcap (2 rods), or Deathblade (2 swords) in stage 1.
- **Item Orb Drops:** When item orbs drop during the game, a component is pulled from your item bag. This means the items you receive from orbs are not entirely random but are instead drawn from the predetermined pool in your item bag.
- **Carousel Rounds:** During carousel rounds 2-4 and 3-4, one of each item component is added to your bag. This addition replenishes your item bag, slightly altering the pool of components available for orb drops.

## Strategic Implications

Understanding the item bag mechanic can significantly impact your TFT strategy:

- **Component Limitation:** Since you start with only one of each component in your bag, and additional components are only added during specific carousel rounds, there is a natural limitation on how many of the same component you can receive from orbs. Specifically, you can only be dropped three of any one component from orbs throughout the early and mid-game.
- **Planning for Itemization:** If your strategy requires four or more of the same component (e.g., needing four Tears for your champions), you must plan to acquire at least one of those components from the carousel or through an augment. This requirement adds a layer of strategic depth to carousel selections and augment choices.

## Conclusion

The item bag mechanic adds a layer of hidden complexity to TFT, influencing how players strategize around itemization and adapt their plans based on the components they receive. By understanding this mechanic, you can better anticipate the items available to you and make more strategic decisions that align with your overall game plan.

Remember, while the item bag influences the components you receive, adaptability and strategic thinking remain key to mastering TFT.
