# Economy and Gold Management in TFT

Understanding and mastering the economy in Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is crucial for success. Effective gold management can give you the edge over your opponents, allowing you to level up faster, reroll for key champions, and build stronger team compositions. This guide will cover the basics of the economy in TFT, with a focus on how interest works and strategies for maximizing your gold.

## Gold Sources

In TFT, gold is your primary resource for buying champions, leveling up your character to increase the champion capacity on your board, and rerolling your champion pool. Here are the main sources of gold:

- **Passive Income:** You receive a base of 5 gold per round.
- **Win/Loss Streaks:** Winning or losing multiple rounds in a row will grant additional gold.
  - Streak gold:
    - 3-4 win/loss streak: 1 gold
    - 5 win/loss streak: 2 gold
    - 6+ win/loss streak: 3 gold
  - It's important to note that you will gain your streak gold after neutral PvE rounds as well. This means that if you are 6 win/loss streak into neutrals, you'll gain 3 extra gold for free.
- **Interest:** Based on your current gold, up to a maximum of 5 gold per round.
- **Selling Champions:** You can sell champions back to the pool for their cost value in gold.
- **PvE Rounds:** Orbs containing gold can be dropped on neutral rounds.

## Interest Mechanic

Interest is one of the key components of the TFT economy, rewarding players for managing their gold efficiently. Here's how interest works:

- **Interest Rate:** You earn 1 gold of interest for every 10 gold you have at the end of a round, up to a maximum of 5 gold. This means if you end a round with 50 or more gold, you'll earn the maximum interest of 5 gold.
- **Interest Thresholds:** The interest is calculated at the end of each round based on your current gold. The thresholds are at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 gold.
- **Strategic Implications:** Knowing when to save gold to maximize interest and when to spend gold to improve your team is a critical strategic decision in TFT.

## Managing Your Economy

Here are some strategies for managing your economy effectively:

- **Econ Up:** Try to save your gold to reach higher interest thresholds quickly, especially if your early game board is strong enough to win or lose minimally.
- **Spend Wisely:** While saving for interest is important, don't be afraid to spend gold on leveling up or rerolling for key champions if it significantly strengthens your team.
- **Win/Loss Streaks:** Manage your board strength to either maintain a win streak for extra gold or manage a loss streak in a way that minimizes health loss while benefiting from the extra gold.
- **Late Game Spending:** As the game progresses and you reach the later stages, be more aggressive with your gold to ensure your team remains competitive. This often means leveling up to increase your team size or rerolling to find essential upgrades.

## Conclusion

Mastering the economy in TFT requires a balance between saving to earn interest and spending to maintain or enhance your board strength. By understanding the sources of gold and how the interest mechanic works, you can make more informed decisions that will help you outmaneuver your opponents and secure victories.

Remember, flexibility and adaptability are key. The best players are those who know when to break the rules of econ to seize a crucial advantage.
